<P>The school has ensured that all the members of the teaching staff are professionally qualified and thus we have an array of NCEs, BEDs, MEDs, and PGDEs etc.<br>
    
    The pupils and staff of  El-shaddai Comprehensive High-Schools are mindful of their ways as they strive under the teacherâ€™s guide to be of good decent personality. Through the help of God we have had great success in minimizing the fighting and bullying pattern that exists in other schools.<br>
     
     El-shaddai Comprehensive High-Schools has updated its computer technology status by linking its computers to the internet and also the school is now on the World Wide Web. Our students are now with the internet facility provided in the school with access restricted to academic online resources, and this makes and helps learning much easy for them.<br>
     
     Our mission is to create and maintain facilities for comprehensive education of children thus preparing them for critical consciousness about themselves and their environment and ultimately grooming them to become the best citizens of the global community and facilitate and activate positive change therein. We strive to be the best school in Osun State<br>
     
     I welcome you once again to  El-shaddai Comprehensive High-Schools official website.</P>
